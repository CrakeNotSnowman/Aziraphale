# ROADMAP: Aziraphale Version 0.0.01
Future expansions are considered in this file. 
Their presence is not a promise that they'll exist, but rather this file serves as an
early outline of features this project hopes to add, as well as changes in directions


The format is adapted from [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
It wont adhere perfectly, but it's a start. 


Dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format


> Aziraphale collected books. If he were totally honest with himself he would have to have admitted that his bookshop was simply somewhere to store them. He was not unusual in this. In order to maintain his cover as a typical second-hand book seller, he used every means short of actual physical violence to prevent customers from making a purchase. Unpleasant damp smells, glowering looks, erratic opening hours -- he was incredibly good at it.

-- Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman of Aziraphale in "Good Omens"
