> Aziraphale collected books. If he were totally honest with himself he would have to have admitted that his bookshop was simply somewhere to store them. He was not unusual in this. In order to maintain his cover as a typical second-hand book seller, he used every means short of actual physical violence to prevent customers from making a purchase. Unpleasant damp smells, glowering looks, erratic opening hours -- he was incredibly good at it.

-- Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman of Aziraphale in "Good Omens"

#### Big Picture: What happened, what was worked on
 - Changed project name from fakeSocial to data_loader, and from data_loader to Aziraphale (small victories matter too). 
 - Similarly project scope changed fairly dramatically, eventually it'll have a target goal of database version control and curration (adding, removing, editing, compressing). But that's for after successfully getting it to interact with data on disk
