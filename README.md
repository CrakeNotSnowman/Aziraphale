# Aziraphale Version 0.0.01

A small library which handles all forms of easily importing database focused data, from bacteria and virus refseq data, question and answer database, wikipedia and stack overflow, and reddit and twitter among others. 


For some of the data (reddit and twitter) this data will eventually become annotated, so it'll be easier to call on a 'currated and approved event' and a 'currated and approved learning post'
